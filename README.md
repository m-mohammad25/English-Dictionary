# English-Dictionary

<p>In this project I used Dictionary API to make an English dictionary which can be used to check different meanings of English words, also to learn how to <strong><i>pronounce</i></strong> them!
I have added the <strong><i>dark mode</i></strong> feature, to make it more readable at night. This webpage is fully <strong><i>responsive</i></strong> to all screen sizes!<br>
Technologies used: <strong><i>BootStrap</i></strong>, <strong><i> Sass</i></strong>, <strong><i> HTML</i></strong>, <strong><i> CSS</i></strong> & <strong><i>JS</i></strong>
